# Microsoft_Classifying-Cybersecurity-Incidents-with_Machine_Learning_project_DS
The Microsoft Cybersecurity Incident Classification project uses machine learning to classify cybersecurity incidents as True Positive, Benign Positive, or False Positive, improving SOC efficiency by automating incident triage and prioritizing responses.

# Overview
This project involves building a machine learning model to enhance the efficiency of Security Operation Centers (SOCs) by accurately predicting the triage grade of cybersecurity incidents. Leveraging the comprehensive GUIDE dataset, the goal is to classify incidents into true positive (TP), benign positive (BP), or false positive (FP) categories. The model should support guided response systems, providing SOC analysts with precise recommendations to improve the overall security posture of enterprise environments.

# Problem Statement
You are a data scientist at Microsoft, tasked with improving the efficiency of SOCs by developing a machine learning model to predict the triage grade of cybersecurity incidents. Using the GUIDE dataset, the model should classify incidents as TP, BP, or FP based on historical data and customer responses. The goal is to create a robust model that generalizes well to unseen data, ensuring reliability in real-world applications.

# Business Use Cases
Security Operation Centers (SOCs): Automate the triage process, enabling SOC analysts to prioritize their efforts on critical threats.

Incident Response Automation: Suggest appropriate actions for incidents, leading to faster threat mitigation.

Threat Intelligence: Enhance detection by incorporating historical data into the triage process, improving the identification of true and false positives.

Enterprise Security Management: Strengthen security posture by reducing false positives and addressing true threats promptly.
Approach
# Data Exploration and Understanding
Initial Inspection: Load the train.csv dataset and perform an initial inspection to understand its structure, feature types, and target variable distribution.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Use visualizations and statistical summaries to identify patterns, correlations, and anomalies, focusing on class imbalances.
# Data Preprocessing
Handling Missing Data: Address missing values through imputation, removal, or using models that inherently handle missing data.

Feature Engineering: Create or modify features to improve model performance, such as deriving new features from timestamps or normalizing numerical variables.

Encoding Categorical Variables: Convert categorical features to numerical using techniques like one-hot encoding, label encoding, or target encoding.
# Data Splitting
Train-Validation Split: Split the train.csv data into training and validation sets, typically using a 70-30 or 80-20 split.
Stratification: Use stratified sampling to ensure similar class distributions in both training and validation sets.
# Model Selection and Training
Baseline Model: Start with a simple model (e.g., logistic regression or decision tree) to establish a performance benchmark.

Advanced Models: Experiment with models like Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Machines, and Neural Networks, tuning them with grid search or random search.

Cross-Validation: Use k-fold cross-validation to ensure consistent model performance across different data subsets.
# Model Evaluation and Tuning
Performance Metrics: Evaluate models using macro-F1 score, precision, and recall, ensuring balanced performance across TP, BP, and FP classes.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model performance by fine-tuning hyperparameters like learning rates, regularization, and tree depths.

Handling Class Imbalance: Address imbalances using techniques like SMOTE, class weighting, or ensemble methods.
# Model Interpretation
Feature Importance: Analyze the importance of features using SHAP values, permutation importance, or model-specific measures.

Error Analysis: Identify and analyze common misclassifications for potential improvements.
# Final Evaluation on Test Set
Testing: Evaluate the finalized model on the test.csv dataset, reporting the macro-F1 score, precision, and recall.

Comparison to Baseline: Compare test set performance to baseline models and validation results to ensure consistency.
# Documentation and Reporting
Model Documentation: Document the entire process, including method selection, challenges, and solutions. Summarize key findings and model performance.

Recommendations: Provide recommendations for integrating the model into SOC workflows, future improvements, and deployment considerations.
# Results
By the end of this project, the goal is to:

Develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts the triage grade of cybersecurity incidents (TP, BP, FP) with a high macro-F1 score, precision, and recall.

Provide a comprehensive analysis of model performance, highlighting influential features.

Produce detailed documentation of the model development process, including potential deployment strategies.

# Project Evaluation Metrics
Macro-F1 Score: Ensures balanced performance across all classes (TP, BP, FP).

Precision: Measures the accuracy of positive predictions, minimizing false positives.

Recall: Measures the model's ability to identify all relevant instances, ensuring true threats are not missed.

# Data Set Overview
The dataset comprises three hierarchies:

Evidence: Supports alerts, containing specific metadata like IP addresses, emails, and user details.

Alerts: Consolidate evidence to signify potential security incidents.

Incidents: Encompass one or more alerts, representing a cohesive narrative of a security breach or threat.

The dataset aims to predict incident triage grades—TP, BP, FP—based on historical customer responses. It includes 45 features, labels, and unique identifiers across 1M triage-annotated incidents. The dataset is split into train (70%) and test (30%) sets, stratified by triage grade, OrgId, and DetectorId.

# Data Set Explanation
The GUIDE dataset records cybersecurity incidents and their triage grades. Preprocessing steps include:

Handling Missing Data: Address missing values in the dataset.

Feature Engineering: Create or modify features to improve model performance.

Normalization/Standardization: Scale numerical features to ensure consistent input data for machine learning models.
